# Video-game-sales-analysis-for-projection

## Project Description 

In this project, I worked for the online store Ice, a platform that sells video games worldwide. I had access to information from open sources, including user and expert reviews, genres, platforms (such as Xbox or PlayStation), and historical game sales data. Using this dataset, I identified patterns that helped determine whether a game could be considered successful. These patterns made it possible to detect promising projects and support the planning of advertising campaigns.

The available data covered information up to the year 2016. Assuming I was working in December 2016, I conducted an analysis aimed at planning campaigns and forecasting sales behavior for 2017.

The main goal of the project was to gain experience working with data. Therefore, the objective was not tied to a specific year; predicting 2017 sales using 2016 data was just as valid as predicting 2027 sales using 2026 data.

The dataset also included a column called "rating", which stored the ESRB rating for each game. This rating, assigned by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, evaluates a game's content and assigns an age category such as Teen or Adult.
